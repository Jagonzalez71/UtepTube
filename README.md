UtepTube is a Java-based video playlist management application that allows users to efficiently manage and interact with their video collections. 
Utilizing a CSV file for data storage, this project enables users to:

List Videos: View all available videos in a structured format.

Add to Playlist: Seamlessly add selected videos to a personalized playlist.

View Playlist: Easily access and review the videos in the user's playlist.

Clear Playlist: Remove all videos from the playlist with a single action.

This project showcases my proficiency in Java, file handling
and object-oriented programming principles, providing an intuitive interface for video management.
